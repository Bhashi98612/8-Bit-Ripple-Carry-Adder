# 8-Bit-Ripple-Carry-Adder

EE552 - VLSI Design - Mini Project
Developed a 8-bit ripple carry adder in Verilog, verified via test bench. Created schematic design using KiCad and verified with ngspice simulation. Constructed layout in Magic using modular approach. Extracted parasitics and performed post-layout simulation with ngspice.
